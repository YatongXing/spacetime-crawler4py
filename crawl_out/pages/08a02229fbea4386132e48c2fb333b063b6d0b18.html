<h1>CS 161, Spring 2019:<br> Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

<hr>

<h2>General Course Information</h2>
<p>The course will be taught by <a href="/~eppstein/">David
Eppstein</a>, eppstein@uci.edu (office hours MW 4-5).
The TAs are Arkadeep Adhikari, arkadeea@uci.edu, and Daokun Jiang, daokunj@uci.edu.</p>

<p>The course meets for lectures Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, from 11:00 &ndash; 11:50, in <a href="http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/HSLH100A.html">Howard Schneiderman Lecture Hall, Room HSLH 100A</a>. In addition there
are four discussion sections.
Students are expected
to be enrolled in one of the discussion sections and to attend
discussions regularly. We will not be taking attendance, and it is ok to attend a different discussion than the one you are enrolled in as long as space permits. At the discussion sections, the teaching assistant will go over homework and midterm
solutions, give additional examples of topics covered in the lecture,
and be available to answer questions.</p>

<p>There is an online forum at Piazza (search for CS161). Lecture materials will not be distributed to the class; instead, you are encouraged to attend the lecture yourself and take your own notes. Recording the lectures for your own personal use, and sharing your materials with other students in the class is allowed, but other uses of recorded lectures (including making them available online) is forbidden.</p>

<p>The course text will be "Algorithm Design and Applications" by
Goodrich and Tamassia (Wiley, 2015). Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (typically due on Fridays and posted on this page before the start of class on Monday of the week it is due)
as well as two midterms and a comprehensive final exam. The overall
grade will be determined 10% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and
40% from the final. Homeworks will be graded 50% for effort,
50% for correctness on one of the assigned problems (chosen arbitrarily
from each problem set).</p>

<p>Homeworks should be turned in through GradeScope. Group work on
homeworks is permitted; however, each student
should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks. Some of the
homework problems will ask you to perform calculations or trace the
steps of an algorithm; you are welcome to use computer programs
to solve these problems rather than doing everything by hand.
Each week's
homework assignment will be given on this web page. Homework is due by
9:00pm on Fridays and must be turned in through dropbox
on eee. No late
homework will be accepted.
Students who add the class after the start of quarter will be
responsible for turning in all earlier homeworks by the following
Friday. The lowest homework score of the quarter will be dropped from
the course average.</p>
