  <LI> <B>Academic Dishonesty</B>
<BR>
    <UL>
      <LI> Instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected
           in the final grade (usually an F)
      <BR> because dishonesty devalues the learning experience for the whole class.
      <BR> Additional consequences may occur at the campus level.
      <LI> Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
          <UL>
            <LI> submitting homework or project code that was not your own work
             <BR> (such as by copying from another person or from a website)
            <LI> copying from others during an examination
            <LI> allowing another student to copy from your work
            <LI> communicating exam answers to other students during an examination
            <LI> using unauthorized materials during an examination
            <LI> tampering with an examination after it has been corrected and then returning it for more credit
          </UL>
