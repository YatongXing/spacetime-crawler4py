<h2> BLIP - Philosophy, Design Decisions, and Experimental Results
</h2>

<h3> Matt Jensen, BLIP

<p>
Basic Lightweight Information Protocol (BLIP) is a new, evolving, open
standard created by volunteers with a non-profit attitude. BLIP's
purpose is to provide a language and platform-independent wire protocol
for high-speed, large-scale, reliable, topic-based messaging. These
"enterprise-level" features will also be required by many
consumer/personal applications in the near future. Providing this within
a simple framework is another BLIP design goal, as future notification
services should be able to run on pocket computers and pager-size
devices. BLIP seems to scale well in early experiments.
