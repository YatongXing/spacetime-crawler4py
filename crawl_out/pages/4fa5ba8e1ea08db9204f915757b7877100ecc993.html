<h2> A Tale of Two Protocols: Social Aspects of "Internet Scale"
</h2>

<h3> Mark Day, Lotus

<p>
A couple of years ago, we designed the Notification Service
Transfer Protocol (NSTP) as a general-purpose coordination mechanism for
building synchronous groupware applications. We have been able to build a
variety of interesting applications with NSTP, and the design seems to
represent a good tradeoff in terms of simplicity, power, and reliability.
We initially thought that a colleague awareness tool (colloquially, a
"buddy list") was just another synchronous groupware application.  However,
as users requested more capabilities, we learned that awareness
applications have a different underlying model of social interaction from
our other, quasi-meeting, applications. Accordingly, we designed the Simple
General Awareness Protocol (SGAP) to address the problems that arise in
sophisticated awareness applications.
