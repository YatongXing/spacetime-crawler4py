<b>Course Description</b>.
Techniques for text pattern matching and algorithms for the storage, retrieval, and classification of textual and multimedia data. Topics include string searching, string data structures, document and website retrieval, and search engines.

<p>
<b>Coursework</b>.
Coursework will consist of in-class quizzes and 
programming projects.
The final grade will be computed based on 30% for 
quizzes and 70% for projects. 
The lowest two quiz scores
will be dropped in computing the overall grade.

<p>
<b>Academic honesty policy</b>.
Collaboration on quizzes and projects is not allowed.
Each quiz and project must be an individual effort.
Working with others will be considered cheating.
Likewise, the use of generative A.I. tools for any purpose other than to improve writing (e.g., spelling and grammar) is prohibited unless specifically allowed.
In addition to the procedures of the
ICS Cheating Policy, students caught cheating will be given a failing grade in the quiz or project in question.

<p>
<b>Laptop policy</b>.
Open laptop computers are not allowed during in-class lectures, unless approved by the instructor or 
the <a href="https://dsc.uci.edu/">Disabled Student Center</a> (DSC).
Laptop computers and smartphones may be used during in-class online quizzes, 
however.

<p>
<b>Late policy</b>. Late projects 
assignments will be graded 20% off for every day late.
