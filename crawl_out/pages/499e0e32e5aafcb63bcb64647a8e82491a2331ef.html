<p>
A cryptarithm
(also known as an 
<a href="https://users.aol.com/s6sj7gt/mikealp.htm">alphametic</a>)
is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula
(typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters;
the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits.
If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem
becomes NP-complete.

Gives an algorithm for finding the minimum number of mutations needed
to transform one input string into another, in a general model
in which substrings may be inserted or deleted at a cost depending
nonlinearly on the substring length.  The time bound

Automata theory.
A reset sequence for a DFA is an input such that, no matter which
state the DFA starts in, it ends up after the input in a known state.
These have been used by Natarajan and Goldberg for certain robot motion
planning problems (in fact the conference version of this paper used
the title "Reset sequences for finite automata
with application to design of parts orienters"), and also in coding
theory where they arise in the design of
self-synchronizing codes.  This paper considers DFAs in which the
transition functions respect a given cyclic ordering of the states, and
shows that their shortest reset sequences can be found quickly.
It also considers parallel algorithms for the problem.
There remains open a gap between <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>n<sup>3</sup></i>
in the maximum length of reset sequences for general automata.

By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O(<i>k</i>)
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving <i>m</i> or <i>n</i>
to one involving min(<i>m,</i> <i>k</i>) or min(<i>n,</i> <i>k</i>)
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the <i>k</i> smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order (<i>k</i>+1) Voronoi diagrams.

<p>
It was known that planar graphs have O(<i>n</i>) subgraphs isomorphic
to K<sub>3</sub> or K<sub>4</sub>. That is, K<sub>3</sub> and
K<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
<p>
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely
K<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

(special issue on computational geometry).
<p>
Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
<a href="geom-lp.html">linear programming</a>
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matou&#353;ek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in "<a href="p-2c.html">Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers</a>",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

<p>
Considers persistence for a naive form of dynamic algorithm in
which each update rebuilds a static solution.
The space bounds for this can often be reduced 
by maintaining an offline
solution over a sequence of updates constructed
from an Euler tour of the persistent update history tree.

that for convex polygons the only points that need to be added are on

used higher order Voronoi diagrams to reduce the geometric

Here I instead use nearest neighbors for a modified
distance function where the bottleneck shortest path length
is subtracted from the true distance between points.

more easily to higher dimensions.

For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).
<p>
Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis">formal
concept analysis</a>. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Given a sequence of edge insertions and deletions in a graph,
finds the corresponding sequence of minimum spanning tree changes,
in logarithmic time per update.
Similarly solves the planar geometric version of the problem
(using a novel "mixed MST" formulation in which part of the input
is a graph and part is a point set) in time

Shows that bichromatic nearest neighbors can be maintained under point
insertion and deletion essentially as quickly as known solutions to the

Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the <i>k</i> shortest in the graph, where <i>k</i> is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.
<p>
The <i>k</i> shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
<i>k</i> shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "<a href="p-dtwmcgf.html">Diameter and treewidth in

<li><b>Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families</b>.<br>
D. Eppstein.<br>
<a href="https://arXiv.org/abs/math.CO/9907126">arXiv:math.CO/9907126</a>.<br>
<i>Algorithmica</i> 27: 275&ndash;291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
<p>
This paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth
property</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
<p>Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"<a href="p-psgi.html">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems</a>" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "<a
href="https://doi.org/10.1145/504794.504798">Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>", <i>J. ACM</i>
48: 1184&ndash;1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "<a href="https://erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/">Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>", <i>Algorithmica</i>
40: 211&ndash;215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
<a href="exponential.html">exponential time
backtracking algorithms</a> for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use <a
href="geom-lp.html">quasiconvex programming</a> to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean

Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+&epsilon;)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n<sup>&epsilon;</sup>-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n<sup>1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&epsilon;</sup> for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
<i>c</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>o</i>(<i>n</i>); for instance, for
planar graphs, <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. We call <i>c</i> the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and&nbsp;3/2.

We find an algorithm for making all possible deductions based on the set
of candidate locations for a single digit in a Sudoku puzzle; the
problem is NP-hard, and our algorithm takes exponential time, but the
mild form of the exponential allows it to be fast for practical problem sizes.

It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under M&ouml;bius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

A cuckoo filter is an approximate set data structure that can be used in
place of a Bloom filter, but with several practical advantages: it uses
less space, has better locality of reference, and can handle element
deletions. We provide the first theoretical analysis of a simplified

guaranteed to hold theoretically and not just experimentally.

A penny graph is the contact graph of unit disks: each disk represents a
vertex of the graph, no two disks can overlap, and each tangency between
two disks represents an edge in the graph.
We prove that, when this graph is triangle free, its degeneracy is at most two.
As a consequence, triangle-free penny graphs have list chromatic number
at most three.
We also show that the number of edges in any such graph is at most
2<i>n</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&Omega;(&radic;<i>n</i>).

We study what happens to nonplanar graphs of low width
(for various width measures) when they are made planar by
replacing crossings by vertices.
For treewidth, pathwidth, branchwidth, clique-width, and tree-depth,
this replacement can blow up the width from constant to linear.
However, for bandwidth, cutwidth, and carving width,
graphs of bounded width stay bounded when we planarize them.

If you fold a piece of paper flat and unfold it again, the resulting
crease pattern forms a planar graph. We prove that a tree can be
realized in this way (with its leaves as diverging rays that reach the
boundary of the paper) if and only if all internal vertices have odd
degree greater than two. On the other hand, for a folding pattern on
an infinite sheet of paper with an added vertex at infinity as the
endpoint of all its rays, the resulting graph must be 2-vertex-connected
and 4-edge-connected.

<p>
The nearest-neighbor classification problem considered here takes as
input a training set of points in a Euclidean space, each with a
classification from some finite set of classes or
colors, and then uses that input to predict the classification of new
points as being equal to that of the nearest neighbor in the input
training set. A training point is irrelevant when removing it from the
training set would produce the same predicted classification for all
possible new points that might be queried. We describe how to find all
of the relevant points, in polynomial time, using a simple algorithm
whose only components are construction of a minimum spanning tree of the
training set and the computation of extreme points (convex hull
vertices) of geometrically transformed subsets of points. For any
constant dimension, with \(k\) relevant points resulting from a training
set of \(n\) points, this method can be made to take time \(O(n^2+k^2n)\),
using only simple algorithms for the minimum spanning tree and extreme
point subroutines. For small dimensions, somewhat better but more complicated bounds are possible.

For two-dimensional scenes consisting of mirrors and opaque walls that
are either axis-parallel or with slope &pm;1, with integer endpoints,
it is possible to determine the eventual destination of rational light
rays in time polynomial in the description complexity of the scene, even
though the number of reflections before a ray reaches this destination
may be exponential. The solution involves transforming the problem into one
involving interval exchange transformations and from there into another
problem involving normal curves on topological surfaces.

If a subset of the plane has a continuous shrinking motion of itself,

For any point set, the numbers of non-crossing paths, non-crossing
Hamiltonian paths, non-crossing surrounding polygons, and non-crossing
Hamiltonian cycles can be bounded above and below by functions of two
simple parameters: the minimum number of points whose deletion leaves a
collinear subset, and the number of points interior to the convex hull.
Because their bounds have the same form, the numbers of the two types of
paths are bounded by polynomials of each other, as are the numbers of
the two types of polygons. We use these relations to list non-crossing
Hamiltonian paths and polygonalizations in time polynomial in the number
of outputs.

The Bellman&ndash;Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths
operates by relaxation steps, in which it checks for a given edge
whether the best path it knows to the start of the edge, plus the
edge itself, is better than the path it already knows to the end of the
edge. We prove that, up to constant factors, Bellman&ndash;Ford is optimal
among algorithms that use relaxation in an edge ordering that does not

Many computational geometry problems can be solved by transforming them
into a graph problem on a geometric graph. When the graph has low width,
for some form of graph width, this can often lead to efficient classical
or parameterized algorithms. We survey the geometric graphs that always
have low width, the geometric graphs that can have high width, and the
opportunities for parameterization obtained by studying low-width

Minisymposium on Mathematical Puzzles and Games in Theoretical Computer

<p>
In puzzles such as Sudoku, one can often make use of an assumption that
the solution is unique, in deduction rules that eliminate alternatives
that would lead to a non-unique solution. However, these rules can lack
the monotonicity properties of other deduction rules, under which a
conclusion that can be deduced from some partially-solved state of the
puzzle remains available to be deduced until it actually is deduced.
I discuss a method of obtaining monotonic deductions in a planar
precoloring extension puzzle, and ask whether there is some more general
method for obtaining monotonicity in this way.

We survey known hardness results on folding origami and prove several
new ones: finding a flat-folded state is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard, but
fixed-parameter tractable in a combination of ply and the treewidth of
an associated graph. Finding a 3d-folded state cannot be expressed in
closed form and cannot be computed by bounded-degree algebraic-root
primitives.  Reconfiguring certain systems of overlapping origami
squares, hinged to a table at one edge, is \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete,
and counting the number of configurations is

folding patterns (even on normal square origami paper) is undecidable.
