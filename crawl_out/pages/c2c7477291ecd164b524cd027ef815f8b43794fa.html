    The plots output will depend on the type of analysis and input parameters.  
    The titles and labels of the plots are largely self-explanatory. 
    Possible plots include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Control Vs. Experimental Scatterplots (before and after normalization).</li>
    <li>Plots of  standard deviation of the expression levels versus the corresponding
      mean, visually answering the question: Is there more
      variation at higher values of expression?  
      This is done for different conditions and normalizations.</li>
    <li>A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve which depicts the tradeoff between
      false positives and true positives when choosing a 
      <i>p-</i>value threshold for PPDE.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are two plotting options:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Plot using density estimate smoothing : Plots will have data binned and colored to show smooth density estimates.
      This allows the user to see the distribution of the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove outliers: Produces plots where outliers (more than 2 IQR above or below the 1st or 2nd quantiles, 
      respectively) have been removed.  This allows the user to see the true relationship by plotting most of the data
      in a reasonable scale.
    </li>
  </ul>
