<h2> Exploiting an Event-based Infrastructure to Develop Complex
Distributed Systems</h2>

<p>
In an event-based architecture, distributed software components
interact by generating and consuming events. The occurrence of an
event in a component (called source) is asynchronously notified to any
other component (called recipient) that has declared some interest in
it. This paradigm holds the promise of supporting a flexible and
effective interaction among highly reconfigurable distributed software
components.  We have developed an object-oriented infrastructure,
called JEDI (Java Event-based Distributed Infrastructure), to support
the development and operation of event-based systems. During the past
year, JEDI has been used to implement the OPSS workflow management
system. A WorkFlow Management System (WFMS) is an environment for
developing and executing process-based applications. A process-based
application is a software system that guides the execution of a
coordinated set of activities involving both humans and computerized
tools. Typical examples, are business services such as customer care
or interoffice procedures.  
The presentation illustrates JEDI main features and how we have used
it to implement the OPSS workflow management system. Moreover, it
provides an initial evaluation of our experiences in using an
event-based architectural style.
