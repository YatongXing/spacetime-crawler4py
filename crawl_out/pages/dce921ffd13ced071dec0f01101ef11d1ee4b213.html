<H1 align=center>The Problems with Being Virtual</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Limited Support for Coordination
<UL>
<LI>Keeping track of progress and potential conflict has required a
    deluge of communication (e-mail)
<LI>Maintaining the Agenda is a manual process
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Entry Barriers
<UL>
<LI>Difficult to browse the current software state
<LI>Difficult to separate areas of development
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Apache succeeds in large part due to the unusual expertise of its
    user/developers
   <UL>
   <LI>all Internet experts
   <LI>capable of compiling, installing software
   </UL>
<P>
<LI>E-mail is not sufficient for resolving interpersonal conflicts
    that are more than just "differences in opinion"
</UL>

The first three problems can be reduced by better tools, but the latter
requires some form of synchronous, voice communication, preferably on a
regular basis.
