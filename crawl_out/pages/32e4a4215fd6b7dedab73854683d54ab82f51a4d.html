  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Normalization and Low-Value Handling (Optional)</h2>
  <p>
    The statistical analyses performed by Cyber-T assumes that the data are approximately normal.  
    This is often not the case with raw microarray (or other high-throughput) data.
    A common technique is to take the natural log (<i>ln</i>) of the data before processing.
    However, this approach has several drawbacks, mainly dealing with the inability to handle negative values.
    An alternative approach called VSN is based on the <i>asinh</i> transform 
    and an assumption of a majority of genes being non-differentially expressed [<a href="/help/#references">12</a>].
    The webserver allows for pre-processing with optional low value thresholding or offsetting, and optional Log or 
    VSN normalizations.  If a Log or VSN normalization is chosen, some plots displaying the effect of the normalization
    are generated.
