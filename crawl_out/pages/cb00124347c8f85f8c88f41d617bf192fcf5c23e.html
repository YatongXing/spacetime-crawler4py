We introduce the fatness parameter of a 4-dimensional polytope P,
(f<sub>1</sub>+f<sub>2</sub>)/(f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>3</sub>).  It is open
whether all 4-polytopes have bounded fatness.
We describe a <a href="geom-hyperbolic.html">hyperbolic geometry</a>
construction that produces
4-polytopes with fatness &gt;&nbsp;5.048, as well as the first infinite
family of 2-simple, 2-simplicial 4-polytopes and an improved lower bound
on the average kissing number of finite
<a href="geom-circle.html">sphere packings</a> in R<sup>3</sup>.
We show that fatness is not bounded for the more general class of
strongly regular CW decompositions of the 3-sphere.

<p>
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by M&ouml;bius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n<sup>3</sup>), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
<a href="geom-lp.html">quasiconvex programming</a> algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed
for several classes of polygons.

A <a href="geom-ss.html">straight skeleton</a> is defined by the locus of points crossed by the
edges and vertices of a polyhedron as it undergoes a continuous
shrinking process in which the faces move inwards at constant speed. We
resolve some ambiguities in the definition of these shapes, define
efficient algorithms for polyhedra with axis-parallel faces, show that
arbitrary polyhedra have strictly more complicated straight skeletons,
and report on results from an implementation of our algorithm for
arbitrary polyhedra.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and
discuss related problems. The algorithms for constructing area-universal
layouts are based on the distributive lattice structure of the set of
all layouts of a given dual graph.

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

An algorithm is data-oblivious if the memory access patterns it makes
depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of
cryptographic protocols that allow algorithmic tasks to be solved by
parties who each have some subset of the input data that they do not
wish to reveal. We show how to solve several basic geometric problems
data-obliviously, including construction of convex hulls, quadtrees, and
well-separated pair decompositions, and computation of closest pairs and
all nearest neighbors.

When matching fingerprints, the data involves planar points each of
which has an associated direction. Motivated by this application, we
consider point matching problems
in which the distance between points combines both their translational
distance and the rotation needed to make their directions align.
We provide fast and simple approximation schemes for matching oriented

We exhibit a hereditary property of planar point sets (depending only on
the order type of a point set) such that under standard assumptions
there is no fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm to find a <i>k</i>-point

properties have FPT algorithms for this problem, including the
properties that are true for all collinear point sets or false for at
least one convex polygon.

For two-dimensional scenes consisting of mirrors and opaque walls that
are either axis-parallel or with slope &pm;1, with integer endpoints,
it is possible to determine the eventual destination of rational light
rays in time polynomial in the description complexity of the scene, even
though the number of reflections before a ray reaches this destination
may be exponential. The solution involves transforming the problem into one
involving interval exchange transformations and from there into another
problem involving normal curves on topological surfaces.

For any point set, the numbers of non-crossing paths, non-crossing
Hamiltonian paths, non-crossing surrounding polygons, and non-crossing
Hamiltonian cycles can be bounded above and below by functions of two
simple parameters: the minimum number of points whose deletion leaves a
collinear subset, and the number of points interior to the convex hull.
Because their bounds have the same form, the numbers of the two types of
paths are bounded by polynomials of each other, as are the numbers of
the two types of polygons. We use these relations to list non-crossing
Hamiltonian paths and polygonalizations in time polynomial in the number
of outputs.

Many computational geometry problems can be solved by transforming them
into a graph problem on a geometric graph. When the graph has low width,
for some form of graph width, this can often lead to efficient classical
or parameterized algorithms. We survey the geometric graphs that always
have low width, the geometric graphs that can have high width, and the
opportunities for parameterization obtained by studying low-width
instances of graphs that sometimes have high width.

We show that many constructions for dense geometric graphs produce
graphs of unbounded flip-width, frustrating the search for natural
classes of graphs that have bounded flip-width but unbounded twin-width.

Non-collinear point sets with integer distances must be finite, for
strictly convex distance functions on the plane, for two-dimensional
complete Riemannian manifolds of bounded genus, and for geodesic
distance on convex surfaces in 3d.

The shortest path or cycle through given planar points (the solution to
the traveling salesperson problem) never crosses itself: any crossing
can be eliminated by a local move that shortens the tour. One might
think that, correspondingly, the longest path or cycle through enough
planar points always crosses itself. We show that this is not the case:
there exist arbitrarily large point sets for which the longest path or
cycle has no crossing.

An algorithm that uses Boolean primitive operations, like comparisons,
that may be erroneous with some small independent probability per call,
may be made to run correctly with high probability by repeating each
primitive enough times to be sure its majority result is correct, but
this incurs a logarithmic time penalty. Prior work avoids this penalty
for sorting; we extend this speedup to algorithms in computational
geometry that can be formulated using path search in DAGs.  Applications
of our "path-guided pushdown random walk" technique include point
location, plane sweep, convex hulls, and Delaunay triangulation.

My 1994 paper "<a href="p-1-steiner.html">On the number of minimal
1-Steiner trees</a>" with Aronov and Bern, in some preliminary
manuscript versions, included a bound of \(O(m^{\lceil
d/2\rceil}n^{\lfloor d/2\rfloor})\) on the complexity of an arrangement
of \(m\) convex polytopes given as intersections of a total of \(n\)
halfspaces, interpolating between the upper bound theorem for polytopes
and the complexity of hyperplane arrangements. However, the manuscript
and the proof were lost. This paper re-proves the result, with better
care for the degenerate cases.

For given elements and a quality function of an element in a subset,
monotonically non-increasing with respect to removals of other elements,
we can find the max-min-quality subset by a decremental greedy algorithm
that repeatedly removes low-quality subsets. We apply this method to
find the max-min-angle polygon for points in the plane, the
max-min-weight cycle in a directed graph, and several generalizations of
both problems.

We define a notion of structural entropy of point sets under which a set
has low entropy when it can be covered by few disjoint triangles that
are either entirely under the hull of the input or presorted, and show
that we can find the hull in time sensitive to this
entropy. Generalizations of the same technique apply to geometric
maxima, lower envelopes, and visibility polygons.
