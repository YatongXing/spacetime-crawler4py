<h2>WISEN Presentation Abstract: </h2>

<h2> Multicast and Publish/Subscribe for Event Notification over IP
</h2>

<h3> John Mathon, VP, TIBCO Software Inc. 
</h3>
<p>
Publish / Subscribe can be used for building highly scalable 
mission critical applications and is a good platform for 
application integration, but did you know it can also be used
to notify users of web page changes, perform intelligently
targeted distributed queries and for efficient nearly instantaneous
voting systems?  We will talk about new protocols for these uses
and other uses.  TIBCO has been known for building trading systems
for the financial world, messaging systems for factories and 
application integration for corporations worldwide with a $2 Billion
installed base, but, publish / subscribe is more of a revolution
than simply another way to do the same old thing.
