The total complexity of the cells in a line arrangement
that are cut by another line is at most 15<i>n</i>/2.
The complexity of cells cut by a convex <i>k</i>-gon

but it remains open whether the second is, or whether
only linear complexity is possible.

By removing edges not involved in some solution,
and contracting edges involved in all solutions,
we reduce the problem to one in a graph with O(<i>k</i>)
edges and vertices.  This simplification step
transforms any time bound involving <i>m</i> or <i>n</i>
to one involving min(<i>m,</i> <i>k</i>) or min(<i>n,</i> <i>k</i>)
respectively.  This paper also introduces the geometric
version of the <i>k</i> smallest spanning trees problem
(the graph version was long known) which it solves using
order (<i>k</i>+1) Voronoi diagrams.

One standard way of constructing Delaunay triangulations
is by iterated local improvement, in which each step
flips the diagonal of some quadrilateral.
For many other optimal triangulation problems, flipping is
insufficient, but the problems can instead be solved
by a more general local improvement step in which
a new edge is added to the triangulation, cutting through
several triangles, and the region it cuts through
is retriangulated on both sides.

<p>
In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.
<p>
In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.
<p>
In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have <a
href="p-mwst.html">total length within a constant factor of
optimal</a>. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "<a href="p-cpack.html">Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation</a>" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that <a href-"p=dihedral.html">any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices</a>.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "<a
href="p-meshgen.html">Mesh generation and optimal triangulation</a>".

Uses Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchies to perform
<a href="geom-lp.html">linear programming</a>
queries in the intersection of several convex polyhedra.
By maintaining a collection of halfspaces as several subsets,
represented by polyhedra, this leads to algorithms for a dynamic
linear program in which updates change the set of constraints.
The fully dynamic results have largely been subsumed
by Agarwal and Matou&#353;ek, but this paper also includes
polylog time results for semi-online problems,
and uses them to give a fast randomized algorithm for the planar
2-center problem (later improved by various authors, most recently
in "<a href="p-2c.html">Faster Construction of Planar Two-Centers</a>",
which re-uses the data structures described here).

Teng and others previously showed that certain geometric graphs had
small separators that could be found by lifting the graph to a sphere
one dimension up and choosing a random great circle.  Here we show
that epsilon-cuttings and the method of conditional expectations can be
used to guide a deterministic prune-and-search method for the same problem.
Applications include finding the intersection graph of a collection of
spheres and computing or approximating the maximum number of spheres
having a common intersection.

"Updating widths and maximum spanning trees using the rotating caliper graph",
which I also used for the journal submission,
but the referees made me change it back.
Dynamic geometry in a model of Mulmuley and Schwarzkopf in which insertions
and deletions are chosen randomly among a worst-case pool of points.
This paper introduces several fundamental techniques
including the <a href="/~eppstein/junkyard/rcg.html">rotating caliper
graph</a> of a point set and a method for performing
decomposible range queries in the average case setting.
It has also since inspired the use of a similar model in dynamic graph
algorithms.

Given a collection of <i>n</i> sites,
a center point is a point (not necessarily a site)
such that no hyperplane through the centerpoint
partitions the collection into a very small and a very large subset.
Center points have been used by Teng and others
as a key step in the construction of geometric separators.
One can find a point with this property by choosing
a random sample of the collection and applying
<a href="geom-lp.html">linear programming</a>,
but the complexity of that method grows exponentially with the dimension.
This paper proposes an alternate method that
produces lower quality approximations (in terms of the size
of the worst hyperplane partition) but takes time
polynomial in both <i>n</i> and <i>d.</i>

For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as <a href="mst.html">minimum spanning trees</a>,
<a href="graph-match.html">matching</a>, and
<a href="tsp.html">traveling salesmen</a>,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt <i>n</i>) and the sum of

We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(<i>n</i>).
For traveling salesmen the O(log <i>n</i>) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
<i>d</i>th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

It is NP-complete, given a simple polygon in 3-space,
to find a triangulated simply-connected surface (without extra vertices)
spanning that polygon.  If extra vertices are allowed,
or the surface may be curved,
such a surface exists if and only if the polygon is unknotted;
the complexity of testing knottedness remains open.
Snoeyink has shown that exponentially many extra vertices may be
required for a triangulated spanning disk.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We use <a href="p-cpack.html">circle-packing methods</a> to generate
quadrilateral meshes for
polygonal domains, with guaranteed bounds both on the quality and the
number of elements.  We show that these methods can generate meshes of
several types:
<ol>
<li>The elements form the cells of a Voronoi diagram,
<li>The elements each have two opposite 90 degree angles,
<li>All elements are kites, or
<li>All angles are at most 120 degrees.
</ol>
In each case the total number of elements is O(<i>n</i>).
The 120-degree bound is optimal; if a simply-connected region has all
angles at least 120 degrees, any mesh of that region has a 120 degree
angle.

We define a notion of geometric thickness, intermediate between the
previously studied concepts of graph thickness and book thickness: a
graph has geometric thickness T if its vertices can be embedded in the
plane, and its edges partitioned into T subsets, so that each subset
forms a planar straight line graph.  We then give upper and lower bounds

<p>
We consider the problem of subdividing a polyhedral domain in R^3 into
cuboids meeting face-to-face. For topological subdivisions (cell
complexes in which each cell is combinatorially equivalent to a cube,
but may not be embedded as a polyhedron) and simply-connected domains, a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
hexahedral mesh is known: a domain with quadrilateral faces can be
meshed if and only if there is an even number of faces. However,
conditions for the existence of polyhedral meshes remain open, as do the
topological versions of the problem for more complicated domain topologies.

We examine <i>flips</i> in which a set of mesh cells connected in a
similar pattern to a subset of faces of a cube or hypercube is replaced
by cells in the pattern of the complementary subset.
We show that certain flip types preserve geometric realizability of a
mesh, and use this to study the question of whether every topologically
meshable domain is geometrically meshable.  We also study flip graph
connectivity, and prove that the flip graph of quadrilateral meshes has
exactly two connected components.

<p>
Which unit-side-length convex polygons can be formed by packing together
unit squares and unit equilateral triangles? For instance one can pack
six triangles around a common vertex to form a regular hexagon. It turns
out that there is a pretty set of 11 solutions. We describe connections

<p>
Delaunay triangulation has been a staple of triangular mesh generation
for a long time.  Why?  As well as being simple, fast, and visually
pleasing, Delaunay triangulations can be shown to be optimal for various
measures of mesh quality; for instance, they avoid sharp angles to the
maximum extent possible.  We review these and other results on
construction of meshes that optimize given quality measures, including
recent work on postprocessing tetrahedral meshes to eliminate slivers.

<p>
Natural neighbor interpolation is a well-known technique for fitting a
surface to scattered data, with some nice properties including
smoothness everywhere except the data and exact fitting of linear functions.
The interpolated surface is formed from a weighted combination of data
values at the "natural neighbors" (neighbors in the Delaunay
triangulation), with weights related to Voronoi cell areas.
We describe a variation of natural neighbor interpolation, using
different weights based on Delaunay circle angles, that remains
invariant when the data is transformed by M&ouml;bius transformations,
and reconstructs harmonic functions in the limit of dense data on a circle.

We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be
generated by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing
the problem geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped
within the intersection of multiple parallelepipeds, and using
colorimetric principles to define a volume-based objective function for
comparing feasible solutions, we develop an algorithm for finding the
optimal gamut in time O(n<sup>3</sup>), where n denotes the number of
projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient
<a href="geom-lp.html">quasiconvex programming</a> algorithms for
alternative objective functions based on
maximizing the quality of the color space extrema.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
<a href="exponential.html">exponential time
backtracking algorithms</a> for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use <a

function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds.

We consider problems of partitioning sets of geometric objects into two
subsets, such that no two objects within the same subset intersect each
other.  Typically, such problems can be solved in quadratic time by
constructing the intersection graph and then applying a graph
bipartiteness testing algorithm; we achieve subquadratic times for
general objects, and O(n log n) times for balls in R^d or simple
polygons in the plane, by using geometric data structures, separator
based divide and conquer, and plane sweep techniques, respectively.
We also contrast the complexity of bipartiteness testing with that of
connectivity testing, and provide evidence that for some classes of
object, connectivity is strictly harder due to a computational
equivalence with Euclidean

We characterize the graphs that can be drawn confluently
with a single confluent track that is tree-like except for three-way
Delta junctions, as being exactly the distance hereditary graphs.
Based on this characterization, we develop efficient algorithms
for drawing these graphs.

We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and
few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are
obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).

triangulated polyhedral model with a single triangle strip</a> by
extending the algorithms to models
with boundaries. We provide two methods: one is based on using an algorithm
for the Chinese Postman problem to find a small set of triangles to
split in order to find a perfect matching in the dual mesh, while the
other augments the model with virtual triangles to remove the boundaries
and merges the strips formed by our previous algorithm on this augmented

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained

The problem is to place as few wedges as possible in the plane
such that a desired polygon can be formed as some monotone Boolean
combination of the wedges. The motivation is for wireless devices to
prove that they are located within a target area by their ability to
communicate with a subset of base stations (the wedges).
We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of wedges needed

bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents
an \(st\)-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between

that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the

sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

A partition of a rectangle into smaller
rectangles is "area-universal" if any vector of areas for the smaller
rectangles can be realized by a combinatorially equivalent partition.
These partitions may be applied, for instance, to cartograms, stylized
maps in which the shapes of countries have been distorted so that their
areas represent numeric data about the countries. We characterize
area-universal layouts, describe algorithms for finding them, and

We investigate distance from a pair of sites defined as the sum of the
distances to each site minus a parameter times the distance between the
two sites. A given set of n sites defines n(n-1)/2 pairs and n(n-1)/2
distances in this way, from which we can determine a Voronoi diagram. As
we show, for a wide range of parameters, the diagram has relatively few
regions because the pairs that have nonempty
Voronoi regions must be Delaunay edges.

We show how to find a stylized map in which regions have been replaced
by rectangles, preserving adjacencies between regions, with constraints
on the orientations of adjacencies between regions. For an arbitrary
dual graph representing a set of adjacencies, and an arbitrary set of
orientation constraints, we can determine whether there exists a
rectangular map satisfying those constraints in polynomial time. The
algorithm is based on a representation of the set of all layouts for a
given dual graph as a distributive lattice, and on Birkhoff's
representation theorem for distributive lattices.

We provide an O(n<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;log<sup>2</sup>n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter &lambda;, find the minimum value of &lambda;
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

We analyze the security of an online geometric database that allows
planar nearest-neighbor queries but that does not wish the entire database to
be copied by a competitor. We show that, under several models of how the
query answers are returned, the database can be copied in a linear or
near-linear number of queries. Our method for the competitor to copy the
database is based on simulating Fortune's sweep-line algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams, backtracking when the simulation discovers the
existence of another point that invalidates earlier parts of the Voronoi
diagram construction, and using retroactive data structures to perform
the backtracking steps efficiently.

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.

We consider balloon drawings of trees, in which each subtree of the root
is drawn recursively within a disk, and these disks are arranged
radially around the root, with the edges at each node spaced equally
around the node so as to achieve the best possible angular
resolution. If we are allowed to permute the children of
each node, then we show that a drawing of this type can be made in which
all edges are straight line segments and the area of the drawing is a
polynomial multiple of the shortest edge length. However, if the child
ordering is prescribed, exponential area might be necessary. We show
that, if we relax the requirement of straight line edges and draw the
edges as circular arcs (a style we call <a

child ordering we can achieve polynomial area.

depend only on the input size and not on the actual input values;
data-oblivious algorithms are an important building block of

of the plane) it is possible to get within a constant factor of the
minimum possible number of handovers that an offline algorithm could achieve.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under M&ouml;bius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.

We extend force-directed methods of graph drawing by adding a force that
pulls vertices towards the center of the drawing, with a strength
proportional to the centrality of the vertex. Gradually scaling up this

edge would force more than one crossing on some edge or edges. Although
maximal 1-planar graphs on <i>n</i> vertices may have as many as

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

A confluent drawing of a graph is a set of points and curves in the
plane with the property that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if
and only if the corresponding points can be connected to each other by
smooth paths in the drawing. We define a variant of
confluent drawing, strict confluent drawing, in which a smooth path
between two vertices (if it exists) must be unique.
We show that it is NP-complete to test whether such drawings exist,
in contrast to unrestricted confluence for which the complexity remains open.
Additionally, we show that finding outerplanar drawings (in which the points
are on the boundary of a disk and the curves are interior to it) with a fixed
cyclic vertex ordering can be performed in polynomial time.
We use circle packings to find nice versions of these drawings in which
all tracks are represented by piecewise-circular curves.

We show that every outerplanar weak pseudoline arrangement (a collection
of curves topologically equivalent to lines, each crossing at most once
but possibly zero times, with all crossings belonging to an infinite
face) can be straightened to a hyperbolic line arrangement. As a
consequence such an arrangement can also be drawn in the Euclidean plane

We construct small universal point sets for dominance drawings of
classes of acyclic graphs, by finding forbidden patterns in the
permutations determined by these drawings and proving the existence
of small superpatterns for the permutations with these patterns forbidden.
In particular, dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-2
partial orders have universal point sets of size
O(<i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup>), derived from superpatterns of the same size
for the 321-avoiding permutations, and dominance drawings of st-planar
graphs have universal point sets of size
O(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>), derived from superpatterns for
riffle shuffles.

We show that many standard graph drawing methods have algebraic
solutions described by polynomials that can have unsolvable Galois groups,
and that can have Galois groups whose order is divisible by large prime
numbers. As a consequence certain models of exact algebraic computation
are unable to construct these drawings.

The balanced circle packings of the title are systems of
interior-disjoint circles, whose tangencies represent the given graph,
and whose radii are all within a polynomial factor of each other.
We show that these packings always exist for trees, cactus graphs,
outerpaths, k-outerplanar graphs of bounded degree when k is at most
logarithmic, and planar graphs of bounded treedepth.
The treedepth result uses a new construction of inversive-distance
circle packings.

Given a plane graph with fixed edge lengths, and an assignment of the
angles 0, 180, and 360 to the angles between adjacent edges, we show how
to test whether the angle assignment can be realized by an embedding of
the graph as a flat folding on a line. As a consequence, we can
determine whether two-dimensional cell complexes with one vertex can be
flattened. The main idea behind the result is to show that each face of
the graph can be folded independently of the other faces.

A forcing set for an origami crease pattern is a subset of the folds
with the property that, if these folds are folded the correct way
(mountain vs valley) the rest of the pattern also has to be folded the
correct way. We use a combinatorial equivalence with three-colored grids
to construct minimum-cardinality forcing sets for the Miura-ori folding
pattern and for other patterns with differing folds along the same line
segments.

If a folding pattern for a flat origami is given, together with a
mountain-valley assignment, there might still be multiple ways of
folding it, depending on how some flaps of the pattern are arranged
within pockets formed by folds elsewhere in the pattern. It turns out to
be hard (but fixed-parameter tractable) to determine which of these ways
is best with respect to minimizing the thickness of the folded pattern.

changes to the optimal solution as the parameter varies is near-linear,

A penny graph is the contact graph of unit disks: each disk represents a
vertex of the graph, no two disks can overlap, and each tangency between
two disks represents an edge in the graph.
We prove that, when this graph is triangle free, its degeneracy is at most two.
As a consequence, triangle-free penny graphs have list chromatic number
at most three.
We also show that the number of edges in any such graph is at most
2<i>n</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&Omega;(&radic;<i>n</i>).
The journal version uses the alternative title "Edge Bounds and Degeneracy of Triangle-Free Penny Graphs and Squaregraphs".

<p>
We show that, although an individual edge in a road network can have
many crossings, real-world road networks have the property that the
crossing graph of their edges is sparse.
We prove that networks with this property are themselves sparse and have
small separators, allowing many fast algorithms to be generalized from
planar graphs to these networks.

We conjecture, based on experiments, that approximating a convex shape
by the set of grid points inside it, for a fine enough grid, and then
finding the convex layers of the resulting point set, produces curves
that are close to those produced by affine curve-shortening, a
continuous process on smooth curves.

<p>
The stable-matching Voronoi diagram of a collection of point sites in
the plane, each with a specified area, is a collection of disjoint
regions of the plane, one for each site and having the specified area,
so that no pair of a point and a site are closer to each other than to
the farthest other site and point that they may be matched to.
We prove nearly-matching upper and lower bounds on the combinatorial
complexity of these diagrams and provide algorithms that can compute them
in a polynomial number of primitive steps.

<p>
When matching fingerprints, the data involves planar points each of
which has an associated direction. Motivated by this application, we
consider point matching problems
in which the distance between points combines both their translational
distance and the rotation needed to make their directions align.
We provide fast and simple approximation schemes for matching oriented
point sets under the directed Hausdorff distance with different allowed
groups of transformations.

We exhibit a hereditary property of planar point sets (depending only on
the order type of a point set) such that under standard assumptions
there is no fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm to find a <i>k</i>-point
subset with the property. On the other hand, several natural classes of
properties have FPT algorithms for this problem, including the
properties that are true for all collinear point sets or false for at
least one convex polygon.

If you fold a piece of paper flat and unfold it again, the resulting
crease pattern forms a planar graph. We prove that a tree can be
realized in this way (with its leaves as diverging rays that reach the
boundary of the paper) if and only if all internal vertices have odd
degree greater than two. On the other hand, for a folding pattern on
an infinite sheet of paper with an added vertex at infinity as the
endpoint of all its rays, the resulting graph must be 2-vertex-connected
and 4-edge-connected.

to allow them to be connected by a conveyor belt.

We precisely characterize the triples vertex angles that are possible
for arc-triangles (curved triangles made from circular arcs), and prove
an existence theorem for a large class of sets of angles for
arc-polygons. Our characterization allows us to prove that every cactus
graph has a planar Lombardi drawing for its natural planar embedding
(the embedding in which each cycle is a bounded face), but that there
exist other embeddings of cacti that have no Lombardi drawing.

<p>
The nearest-neighbor classification problem considered here takes as
input a training set of points in a Euclidean space, each with a
classification from some finite set of classes or
colors, and then uses that input to predict the classification of new
points as being equal to that of the nearest neighbor in the input
training set. A training point is irrelevant when removing it from the
training set would produce the same predicted classification for all
possible new points that might be queried. We describe how to find all
of the relevant points, in polynomial time, using a simple algorithm
whose only components are construction of a minimum spanning tree of the
training set and the computation of extreme points (convex hull
vertices) of geometrically transformed subsets of points. For any
constant dimension, with \(k\) relevant points resulting from a training
set of \(n\) points, this method can be made to take time \(O(n^2+k^2n)\),
using only simple algorithms for the minimum spanning tree and extreme
point subroutines. For small dimensions, somewhat better but more complicated bounds are possible.

For two-dimensional scenes consisting of mirrors and opaque walls that
are either axis-parallel or with slope &pm;1, with integer endpoints,
it is possible to determine the eventual destination of rational light
rays in time polynomial in the description complexity of the scene, even
though the number of reflections before a ray reaches this destination
may be exponential. The solution involves transforming the problem into one
involving interval exchange transformations and from there into another
problem involving normal curves on topological surfaces.

If a subset of the plane has a continuous shrinking motion of itself,

For any point set, the numbers of non-crossing paths, non-crossing
Hamiltonian paths, non-crossing surrounding polygons, and non-crossing
Hamiltonian cycles can be bounded above and below by functions of two
simple parameters: the minimum number of points whose deletion leaves a
collinear subset, and the number of points interior to the convex hull.
Because their bounds have the same form, the numbers of the two types of
paths are bounded by polynomials of each other, as are the numbers of
the two types of polygons. We use these relations to list non-crossing
Hamiltonian paths and polygonalizations in time polynomial in the number
of outputs.

Many computational geometry problems can be solved by transforming them
into a graph problem on a geometric graph. When the graph has low width,
for some form of graph width, this can often lead to efficient classical
or parameterized algorithms. We survey the geometric graphs that always
have low width, the geometric graphs that can have high width, and the
opportunities for parameterization obtained by studying low-width
instances of graphs that sometimes have high width.

Testing whether an origami folding pattern can be folded flat is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by two parameters: the ply
(maximum number of layers) of the folding, and the treewidth of a planar
graph describing the arrangement of polygons in the flat-folded result.
The dependence on treewidth is optimal under the exponential-time hypothesis.

We survey known hardness results on folding origami and prove several
new ones: finding a flat-folded state is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard, but
fixed-parameter tractable in a combination of ply and the treewidth of
an associated graph. Finding a 3d-folded state cannot be expressed in
closed form and cannot be computed by bounded-degree algebraic-root
primitives.  Reconfiguring certain systems of overlapping origami
squares, hinged to a table at one edge, is \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete,
and counting the number of configurations is
\(\#\mathsf{P}\)-complete. Testing flat-foldability of infinite fractal
folding patterns (even on normal square origami paper) is undecidable.

The shortest path or cycle through given planar points (the solution to
the traveling salesperson problem) never crosses itself: any crossing
can be eliminated by a local move that shortens the tour. One might
think that, correspondingly, the longest path or cycle through enough
planar points always crosses itself. We show that this is not the case:
there exist arbitrarily large point sets for which the longest path or
cycle has no crossing.

An algorithm that uses Boolean primitive operations, like comparisons,
that may be erroneous with some small independent probability per call,
may be made to run correctly with high probability by repeating each
primitive enough times to be sure its majority result is correct, but
this incurs a logarithmic time penalty. Prior work avoids this penalty
for sorting; we extend this speedup to algorithms in computational
geometry that can be formulated using path search in DAGs.  Applications
of our "path-guided pushdown random walk" technique include point
location, plane sweep, convex hulls, and Delaunay triangulation.

of \(m\) convex polytopes given as intersections of a total of \(n\)
halfspaces, interpolating between the upper bound theorem for polytopes
and the complexity of hyperplane arrangements. However, the manuscript
and the proof were lost. This paper re-proves the result, with better
care for the degenerate cases.

For given elements and a quality function of an element in a subset,
monotonically non-increasing with respect to removals of other elements,
we can find the max-min-quality subset by a decremental greedy algorithm
that repeatedly removes low-quality subsets. We apply this method to
find the max-min-angle polygon for points in the plane, the
max-min-weight cycle in a directed graph, and several generalizations of
both problems.

We define a notion of structural entropy of point sets under which a set
has low entropy when it can be covered by few disjoint triangles that
are either entirely under the hull of the input or presorted, and show
that we can find the hull in time sensitive to this
entropy. Generalizations of the same technique apply to geometric
maxima, lower envelopes, and visibility polygons.

<p>
For each smooth convex curve \(C\), and each planar graph \(G\), there
exists a straight-line drawing of \(G\) all of whose faces are crossed
by \(C\). This result serves as a counterexample to an argument that
universal point sets for planar graph drawing cannot be covered by few
convex polygons.
