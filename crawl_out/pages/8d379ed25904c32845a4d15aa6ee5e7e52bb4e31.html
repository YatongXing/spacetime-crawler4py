<h4>Basic file input parameters</h4>
<p>This data comes from a previously published protein microrray study of  the natural 
  immune response to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> [<a href="/help/#references">10</a>].
  The array consists of 2,320 probes.  
  The specific analysis analyzed the sera of children who did (n=29) and did not (n=12)
  have a clinical malaria episode in the following malaria season.
  For illustrative purposes, this dataset is a subset of two data points each from the malaria positive
  and malaria negative children.
</p>
<p>
  It has been shown that DNA microarray analysis techniques, like Cyber-T, work well on this type of data 
  <a href="/help/#references">[13]</a>.
  The data file is comma-delimited.
  The data has not been transformed.  
  It is common to use a <a href="/help/#normalization">VSN</a> normalization for this type of data.
  There is one header row.
  There is one label column, and then there are 2 columns for the malaria positive children  and then 
  2 columns for the malaria negative children.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delimiter: Commas</li>
  <li>Row Start: 2</li>
  <li>Number of label columns: 1</li>
  <li>Number of first condition columns: 2</li>
  <li>Number of second condition columns: 2</li>  
</ul>

<h4>Bayes-regularized Analysis Parameters</h4>
<p>
  This performs a two-sample t-test using the Bayes-regularized variance estimates.
  The data is normalized using VSN.
  PPDE analysis and multiple hypothesis testing correction are performed on the p-values.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normalization: VSN</li>
  <li>Bayes Sliding Window: 101</li>
  <li>Bayes Confidence: 6 </li>
  <li>Run PPDE: checked</li>
  <li>Run Multiple Hypothesis Testing Correction: checked</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non Bayes-regularized Analysis Parameters</h4>
<p>
  This is equivalent to a standard t-test using empirical variances.  
  The data is normalized using VSN.
  PPDE analysis and multiple hypothesis testing correction are performed on the p-values.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normalization: VSN</li>
  <li>Bayes Confidence: BLANK (Default)</li>
  <li>Run PPDE: checked</li>
  <li>Run Multiple Hypothesis Testing Correction: checked</li>
</ul>
