<p>
For many geometric graph problems for points in the unit square,
such as <a href="mst.html">minimum spanning trees</a>,
<a href="graph-match.html">matching</a>, and
<a href="tsp.html">traveling salesmen</a>,
the sum of edge lengths is O(sqrt <i>n</i>) and the sum of
<i>d</i>th powers of edge lengths is O(log <i>n</i>).
We provide a "gap theorem" showing that if these bounds do not hold
for a class of graphs, both sums will instead be Omega(<i>n</i>).
For traveling salesmen the O(log <i>n</i>) bound is tight
but for some other graphs the sum of
<i>d</i>th powers of edge lengths is O(1).

<p>
Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/betadil.html">empirical
network analysis</a> and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta&gt;0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(n<sup>c</sup>), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

<p>
We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

We show how to test the dilation of a star, embedded in a Euclidean
space of bounded dimension, in time O(n&nbsp;log&nbsp;n),
and how to find the star center that has the minimum dilation for
a given set of leaf points in randomized expected time
O(n&nbsp;log&nbsp;n).
For two-dimensional points, we can find the minimum dilation center,
constrained to be one of the input points, in time
O(n&nbsp;2<sup>&alpha;(n)</sup>&nbsp;log<sup>2</sup>n).
The unconstrained center placement algorithm involves
<a href="geom-lp.html">quasiconvex programming</a>, and is used
as a subroutine in the constrained center placement algorithm.

The problem is to quickly find, in a set of sites with weights, the site
maximizing the product of its weight with its distance from the query
point. Our solution combines known results on core-sets with a reduction
from the weighted to the unweighted problem that works in any metric
space. This leads to fast approximation algorithms for the constrained
minimum dilation star problem in any fixed dimension.

We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph
that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the
point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include
convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other
infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets
can be computed efficiently.

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

<p>
If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

We provide an O(n<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;log<sup>2</sup>n) algorithm for
finding a non-distance-decreasing mapping from a given metric into a
star metric with as small a dilation as possible. The main idea is to
reduce the problem to one of parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
Specifically, we transform the problem into the parametric negative cycle
detection problem: given a graph in which the edge weights are linear
functions of a parameter &lambda;, find the minimum value of &lambda;
for which the graph contains no negative cycles. We find a new strongly
polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and use it to solve the star
metric embedding problem.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

We show that, although an individual edge in a road network can have
many crossings, real-world road networks have the property that the
crossing graph of their edges is sparse.
We prove that networks with this property are themselves sparse and have
small separators, allowing many fast algorithms to be generalized from
planar graphs to these networks.

Greedy spanners are graphs formed from sets of geometric points by
considering the pairs of points in sorted order by distance and adding
an edge whenever a pair cannot be connected by a short path through the
previously-added edges. We show that for points in the Euclidean plane,
these graphs have linearly many crossings, that the intersection graph
of their edges has bounded degeneracy, and that they have separators of
square-root size.

<p>
We find a way to maintain a spanner of a dynamic point set, a graph
approximating its distances to within a \(1+\varepsilon\) factor while
maintaining weight proportionate to the minimum spanning tree. Each
change to the point set leads to a logarithmic number of changes to the
spanner, although update times remain slow.
