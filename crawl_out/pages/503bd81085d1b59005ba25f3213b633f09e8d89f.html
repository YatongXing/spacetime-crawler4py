<h2>WISEN Presentation Abstract: </h2>

<h2> Internet Printing Events and Notification
</h2>

<h3> Scott A. Isaacson, Corporate Architect, Novell Inc.

<p>
The Printer Working Group (PWG) and the IETF-chartered Internet Printing
Protocol (IPP) working group are working to define the event notification
operations and semantics associated with Internet printing.  This presentation 
gives the back ground and context for this work and how it relates to network 
printers and distributed printing systems in general.  Proposed requirements 
and solutions are discussed.  The proposals address issues relating to roles, 
terminology, internationalization, print job requests with notification 
subscriptions, security and quality of service parameters, event reports and 
formats, mutliple delivery methods, and the types of printing-related events 
and their groupings.
