<h1>Twenty-one Proofs of Euler's Formula: \(V-E+F=2\)</h1>

<p>Many theorems in mathematics are important enough that they have been
proved repeatedly in surprisingly many different ways. Examples of this
include <a
href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/topology/primes.top">the
existence of infinitely many prime numbers</a>, <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060925091238/http://www.maths.ex.ac.
uk/~rjc/etc/zeta2.dvi">the evaluation <span
style="white-space:nowrap">of \(\zeta(2)\)</a>,</span> the fundamental
theorem of algebra (polynomials have roots), quadratic reciprocity (a
formula for testing whether an arithmetic progression contains a square)
and the Pythagorean theorem (which according to <a
href="refs.html#Wells">Wells</a> has at least 367 proofs). This also
sometimes happens for unimportant theorems, such as the fact that in any
rectangle dissected into smaller rectangles, if each smaller rectangle
has integer width or height, so does the large one.</p>

<p>This page lists proofs of the Euler formula: for any convex
polyhedron, the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two
more than the number of edges. Symbolically <span
style="white-space:nowrap">\(V-E+F=2\).</span> For instance, a
tetrahedron has four vertices, four faces, and six edges; <span
style="white-space:nowrap">\(4-6+4=2\).</span></p>

<p>Long before Euler, in 1537, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Maurolico">Francesco
Maurolico</a> stated the same formula for the five <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">Platonic solids</a>
(see <a href="refs.html#Fri">Friedman</a>). Another version of the
formula dates over 100 years earlier than Euler, to Descartes in 1630.
Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, stating
that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron <span
style="white-space:nowrap">is \(2\pi(V-2)\),</span> from which he infers
that the number of plane angles <span style="white-space:nowrap">is
\(2F+2V-4\).</span> The number of plane angles is always twice the
number of edges, so this is equivalent to Euler's formula, but later
authors such as <a href="refs.html#Lak">Lakatos</a>, <a
href="refs.html#Mal">Malkevitch</a>, and Polya disagree, feeling that
the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to
be viewed as the same formula. The formula \(V-E+F=2\) was
(re)discovered by Euler; he wrote about it twice in 1750, and in 1752 <a
href="refs.html#Eu">published the result</a>, with a faulty proof by
induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and
retriangulating the hole formed by its removal. The retriangulation step
does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the
resulting shape, so the induction does not go through. Another early
attempt at a proof, by Meister in 1784, is essentially the <a
href="triangle.html">triangle removal proof</a> given here, but without
justifying the existence of a triangle to remove. In 1794, <a
href="refs.html#Leg">Legendre</a> provided a complete proof, using <a
href="sphere.html">spherical angles</a>. Cauchy got into the act in
1811, citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle
removal, <a href="ear.html">ear decomposition</a>, and tetrahedron
removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into
smaller polyhedra. <a href="refs.html#HilPed">Hilton and Pederson</a>
provide more references as well as entertaining speculation on Euler's
discovery of the formula. Confusingly, other equations such as
\(e^{i\pi}=-1\) and \(a^{\varphi(n)}=1\bmod n\) also go by the name of
"Euler's formula"; Euler was a busy man.</p>

<p>The polyhedron formula, of course, can be generalized in many
important ways, some using methods described below. One important
generalization is to planar graphs. To form a planar graph from a
polyhedron, place a light source near one face of the polyhedron, and a
plane on the other side.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="shadow.png" width=350 height=301
alt="shadow of a polyhedron"></p>

<p>The shadows of the polyhedron edges form a planar graph, embedded in
such a way that the edges are straight line segments. The faces of the
polyhedron correspond to convex polygons that are faces of the
embedding. The face nearest the light source corresponds to the outside
face of the embedding, which is also convex. Conversely, any planar
graph with certain connectivity properties comes from a polyhedron in
this way.</p>

<p>Some of the proofs below use only the topology of the planar graph,
some use the geometry of its embedding, and some use the
three-dimensional geometry of the original polyhedron. Graphs in these
proofs will not necessarily be <em>simple</em>: edges may connect a
vertex to itself, and two vertices may be connected by multiple edges.
Several of the proofs rely on the Jordan curve theorem, which itself has
multiple proofs; however these are not generally based on Euler's
formula so one can use Jordan curves without fear of circular
reasoning.</p>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu">send email</a>
if you know of a proof not listed here.
I would especially appreciate proofs involving cohomology theory,
toric varieties, or other higher mathematics.
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010222005322/http://hverrill.net/pages~helena/toricpoly/toriceuler.html">Helena Verrill has shown</a> that
Euler's
formula is equivalent to the fact that every toric variety over \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)
has a number of points equal to \(1 \bmod p\)
but is still missing a nice non-combinatorial proof of the latter fact.)</p>

<p>I imagine it would be possible to construct inductions
based on the representation of convex polyhedra as intersections
of halfspaces or convex hulls of points, but the need to
handle inputs in non-general position would make the resulting
proofs quite messy.</p>

<p>There also seems to be a potential connection
to binomials: if one defines a polynomial \[p(t) = 1+Vt+Et^2+Ft3+t^4,\]
the Euler
formula can be interpreted
as saying that \( p(t) \) is divisible by \(1+t\).
But for simplices of any dimension, \(p(t)=(1+t)^{d+1}\) by the binomial formula.
Perhaps there is a proof of Euler's formula that uses
these polynomials directly rather than merely translating
one of the inductions into polynomial form.
<a href="propp.html">Jim Propp
asks similar questions for infinite-dimensional polytopes</a>,
interpreting \(p(t)\) as a power series
(see also <a href="refs.html#Propp">his
expansion of these ideas</a>).</p>
