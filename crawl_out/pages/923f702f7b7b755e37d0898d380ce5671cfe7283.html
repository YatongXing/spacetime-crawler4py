<p>
Considers situations in which two hard approximation problems are
presented by means of a single input. In many cases it is possible to
guarantee that one or the other problem can be approximated to within a
better approximation ratio than is possible for approximating it as a
single problem. For instance, it is possible to find either a
(1+&epsilon;)-approximation to a 1-2 TSP defined from a graph or a
n<sup>&epsilon;</sup>-approximation to the maximum independent set of
the same graph, despite lower bounds showing nonexistence of
approximation schemes for 1-2 TSP and nonexistence of approximations
better than n<sup>1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;&epsilon;</sup> for independent set.
However, for some other pairs of problems, such as hitting set and set
cover, we show that solving the paired problem approximately is no
easier than solving either problem independently.

<p>
ERGMs (exponential random graph models) are used in social science to
describe probability distributions on graphs that are supposed to mimic
real-world social networks. However, we show that (with features that
are standard in the social science application) the distributions given
by these models can be computationally infeasible to sample from or
to approximate the probability of seeing a given graph.

We prove that when a graph of bounded size has its edges subdivided to
form a larger graph, it is still possible to find its metric dimension
by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the
pre-subdivision size of the graph.

<p>
The <i>d</i>K-series is an extension of the degree sequence of a graph to a 
<i>d</i>-dimensional tensor, describing the number of <i>d</i>-tuples of
vertices with
each possible combination of degrees and adjacencies. As we show, it is
NP-hard to determine whether such a tensor represents a valid graph, for
any <i>d</i>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3, or for <i>d</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 if the
number of triangles in the graph is also specified (or constrained to be
zero).

<p>
We show how to modify a small number of edges in a large social network
in order to make the modified copy easy to identify, even if an
adversary tries to hide the modification by permuting the vertices and
flipping a much larger number of edges. The result depends on the random
fluctuation of vertex degrees in such networks, and the ability to
uniquely identify vertices by their adjacencies to a small number of
high-degree landmark vertices. This paper won the best student paper
award at ISC for its student co-authors Lam, Mamano, and Torres.

The associahedron is a polytope whose vertices represent the
triangulations of a convex polygon, and whose edges represent flips
connecting one triangulation to another. We show that a random walk on

The Bellman&ndash;Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths
operates by relaxation steps, in which it checks for a given edge
whether the best path it knows to the start of the edge, plus the
edge itself, is better than the path it already knows to the end of the
edge. We prove that, up to constant factors, Bellman&ndash;Ford is optimal
among algorithms that use relaxation in an edge ordering that does not
depend on the results of earlier relaxation steps.

Invited talk, <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/~wlochet/workshop/">Workshop

<p>
Many computational geometry problems can be solved by transforming them
into a graph problem on a geometric graph. When the graph has low width,
for some form of graph width, this can often lead to efficient classical
or parameterized algorithms. We survey the geometric graphs that always
have low width, the geometric graphs that can have high width, and the
opportunities for parameterization obtained by studying low-width
instances of graphs that sometimes have high width.

In graphs of bounded bandwidth, the number of vertices per level of a
breadth-first search tree is at most polylogarithmic, with the exponent
of the polylogarithm both upper and lower bounded by functions of the
bandwidth. This has applications to the Cuthull-McKee heuristic and
reverse Cuthull-McKee heuristic in sparse numerical algebra, to
reconstructing an unknown graph by shortest distance queries, and to
drawing graphs as arc diagrams of small height.

For given elements and a quality function of an element in a subset,
monotonically non-increasing with respect to removals of other elements,
we can find the max-min-quality subset by a decremental greedy algorithm
that repeatedly removes low-quality subsets. We apply this method to
find the max-min-angle polygon for points in the plane, the
max-min-weight cycle in a directed graph, and several generalizations of
both problems.

<p>
The subdivided double construction turns a 4-regular graph into a bigger
4-regular graph, by subdividing each edge and doubling each vertex. We
prove that the resulting graphs, which include the Folkman graph, have
the following curious property: every Hamiltonian cycle (of which there
are exponentially many) is complementary to another Hamiltonian cycle.
