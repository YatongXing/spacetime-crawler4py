<h2><b>Michael Shindler</b></h2>
I am an Associate Professor of Teaching in the <a href="http://www.cs.uci.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>.
<br /><br />

Office: DBH 4058<br /><br />

If you want to meet with me, for example if you are thinking of graduate school and want to discuss it, and would otherwise drop by my office hours, but aren't in my class this term, please send me an email and I will try to find time to meet with you.

 <br /><br />

To form my email address:

	<li>
For course-related topics, concatenate <tt>mikes</tt> with <tt>[at] ics [dot] uci [dot] edu</tt>
	</li>
	<li>
		For all other topics, concatenate <tt>mikes</tt> with <tt>[at] uci [dot] edu</tt>
</ul>
My research focuses primarily on educational issues in computer science;  I am particularly interested in issues related to teaching Computer Science Theory courses, such as identifying and correcting student misconceptions in these courses and also discovering concept inventories.  I am also interested in more general issues involving the scaling of class sizes and making efficient use of resources for student learning.  

<br /><br />
In the past, my computer science research touched on computations on large datasets, machine learning, approximation algorithms, streaming algorithms, and data mining.

<br /><br />

	If you are planning to ask me for a letter of recommendation, please <a href="letters.html">read this first</a>.

<h3>Teaching</h3>

For every class I teach, <I>all students are responsible for all material and due dates in the class, even those that occur prior to their enrollment.</I>  If you are planning to add the class after day one, please contact me at the start of the quarter, preferably at the conclusion of the first lecture.  You should plan to attend every lecture starting at day one, even if you are not yet enrolled.  Students who are not enrolled may still submit assignments and take exams.  <!-- If the class is virtual/remote, contact me for a link.--> <br /><br />


I use Canvas to post course material.  During the quarters I am teaching, course links here should point you to a <B>public Canvas</B> page -- even if you are not enrolled in the class, you should still be able to see the files listing (which will contain handouts, assignments, slides, and so on).  This means you should also be able to enroll in GradeScope, even if you are not enrolled (yet) in the class, to be able to submit assignments.  Previous quarters are available below (Fall 2022 to present).

	<ul>
		<li>There are two lectures of this class.  Students are welcome to attend either one, regardless of enrollment, with the following two exceptions:

		<ul>
			<li>On exam days, you are required to take the exam in your enrolled section.</li>
			<li>If we run out of seats on non-exam days, priority for seating is for students enrolled in the section.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For students who want a review of prerequisite concepts, a <A HREF="ics46/ProblemSets/2023_01W_46___Problem_Set_0.pdf">Problem Set Zero</A> has been posted.  It will not be collected. </li>
	<li>Students should also be familiar with the fundamentals of C++, as we'll be using that as our programming language in this course.  Professor Thornton has some wonderful notes and examples available <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics45c/Notes/">here</a>.  I particularly encourage students to be comfortable with linked data structures and templates.

				<li> I <I>strongly recommend</I> anyone taking this class to have a computer with an Intel (or compatible) processor.  The Virtual Machine we use for programming assignments is designed with this in mind.  If you do not own such a machine, you may use the computers in ICS1-364.  This class might not be providing support for computers with other processors, such as M1 Macs.</li>

 For the remainder of the 2024-25 school year, I am tentatively set to teach the following courses.  These courses will be offered on-campus and in-person.

For the 2025-26 school year, I am tentatively set to teach the following courses.   These courses will be offered on-campus and in-person. <br />
    Students should plan their schedules with the expectation that attendance at both lecture and discussion is required.

    <ul>
        <li>Fall 2025:
            <ul>
                 <li>CompSci 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms [ <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/77112">Canvas Link</a> ]

We will also do some review in lecture and discussion early in the quarter.  Despite that the linked document was prepared for the Spring 2025 version of the course, it is still the relevant prerequisite review for Fall 2025. </li>

<h4>Past Teaching</h4>

    Starting in Fall 2022, I made all pages public.  For the 2022-23 school year, I have separate pages for the materials.  <br />
    
    After that, these are public Canvas pages.  Some course material remained available only to those enrolled, such as homework <br />
    
    solutions.  Syllabi, assignments, diagnostic exams, and handouts remain available to the public. <br /> <br />
