          <h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction"> Introduction</a></h3>
          <p> As a student you are probably aware of certain ethical responsibilities
            you have, such as honesty in doing classwork. Another area in which
            you have important ethical responsibilities is in your use of computing
            resources. This document describes some of these responsibilities
            and explains ICS Department policy on student use of computing resources.
            Some of these policies might be different from what you would expect,
            so please read over and understand this document.
          </p>
          <p> The ICS department provides for you, the student, a wide range
            of computing resources from X-Terminals to PC's to large multiuser
            UNIX systems. These machines are expensive to buy and expensive to
            maintain, but it is our goal to provide you with the very best computing
            environment that we can. Many users depend on these computers for
            doing class assignments, research, and for communications. We are
            a community of computer users, and like any community we can all
            make the best use of our resources if we establish some guidelines
            for how we can use them responsibly.
          </p>
          <p> Some computing facilities, such as those which hold classified
            data, may establish expensive and complex security systems In our
            department we do not do this; we have some security mechanisms which
            greatly decrease the risk that one user will accidentally interfere
            with another, but it does not require great ingenuity to get around
            these mechanisms. As a result, we need to trust the people who use
            our machines.
          </p>
          <p> The fundamental principle behind our policies is this: While using
            the computers, you should never do anything that harms another user
            or prevents him or her from getting work done.
          </p>
          <p> If you have any questions about these rules, or if you suspect
            that an account (your or someone else's) has been broken into, please
            contact the ICS Computing Support Group. To do this, send mail to
            the address <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ics.uci.edu"> helpdesk@ics.uci.edu</a>,
            or go to Support's office, CS346, and explain the problem.

          <p> The ICS Department has a wide range of computers available, located
            in several different labs. Some of these labs are open only to people
            enrolled in certain classes, some are available for general drop-in
            use. Each ICS major is given both a Windows account, and a UNIX account
            on the Sun workstations. Different courses will require different
            platforms to be used. Non-majors will be given accounts only if required
            for a course in which they are enrolled.
          </p>
          <p> All ICS computers are to be used only by ICS students, faculty,
            and staff. People outside ICS who wish to use computers should go
            see the people in the <a href="http://www.nacs.uci.edu/">Network and Academic Computing Services</a> (Engineering
            Gateway, room 2130). They provide computing for non-ICS people.
          </p>
          <p> Any computer account created for you remains the property of the
            Regents of the University of California. You are responsible for
            this account, and you may not allow any other person to use it. The
            primary purpose of your account is to allow you to carry out your
            computing assignments and other instructional activities. You may
            also make modest use of these resources for other purposes, such
            as sending electronic mail to friends on campus, reading the electronic
            bulletin boards, and playing games, provided that this usage does
            not significantly interfere with instructional use of the machines.
          </p>
          <p> An example of how one might &quot;significantly interfere&quot; would
            be to tie up a computer for game-playing when no other computers
            are free and someone else is waiting to use the computer to do an
            assignment. If you have a game or other program you would like to
            make available to other users, please give it to the system administrator
            for public installation (You can contact the system administrator
            by sending mail to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ics.uci.edu"> helpdesk@ics.uci.edu</a>).
            You may not use the machines for commercial purposes, such as preparing
            bills for your company or advertising products, or for work related
            to non-UCI organizations, such as an off-campus political or religious
            group. More details about this are given below. If you are in doubt
            about whether some use of the machines is allowed, ask the Support
            Group.

          <h3><a name="behavior" id="behavior"> Ethical Behavior</a></h3>
          <p> Here is a list of some examples of activities that the department
            does not allow. If a student makes such unethical use of ICS computers,
            he/she will be subject to the penalties described in the <a href="#disciplinary"> Disciplinary
              Procedures</a> section.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> You may not introduce viruses, worms, Trojan horses, password
              cracking or login spoofing programs on any University computer
              or network. In fact, because of the serious damage such programs
              can cause, the ICS Department faculty have adopted a policy which
              forbids students even to have these types of programs in their
              accounts or to place them onto any Department computer; you may
              not store such a program on a departmental computer even if you
              only wish to study it.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> You may not try to use equipment or accounts that
              you are not allowed to use.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> You may not interfere with others' ability to make use of the resources. For example, it might be reasonable to lock a workstation if you need to leave the room for two or three minutes, but it is not reasonable to lock it while you leave to buy lunch. Another example would be doing something that ties up all or a significant fraction of the machine, thus preventing others from receiving their fair share.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> You
              may not destroy
              other people's
              work.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> You may not &quot;spy&quot; on people, that is, you may not attempt to gain information from their accounts or from their diskettes when there is good reason to believe that they do not wish you to obtain that information. This includes both attempting to violate the protection facilities provided by the system and also taking deliberate advantage of someone else's failure to protect sensitive information on their account. This works both ways. For example, it would be unethical for a faculty member or Support Group member to browse through your personal messages just out of curiosity, even if they have a security level that allows them to do so; we agree to respect your privacy. We do, however retain the right to inspect material on your account when this is necessary to investigate a suspected violation of university rules, such as a cheating incident or a violation of the rules in this document.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> You may not send mail that appears to come from someone else.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> You may not advertise any commercial products or use your account to earn money. Non-commercial things like posting your used car advertisement on <kbd> ics.market</kbd> are permitted,
            </li>
          </ul>
