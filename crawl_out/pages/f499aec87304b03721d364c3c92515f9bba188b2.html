<h2> Event Notification Protocol: Architecture
</h2>

<h3> Surendra Reddy, Oracle

<p>
 As the complexity of distributed applications increases, an
    increasing amount of processing is done using distributed processes,
   which typically execute without the direct supervision of an end
    user. The user must poll these processes periodically to check if
    they are completed successfully or not. This polling results in
    unnecessary wastage of network bandwidth as well as computing
    resources. The user generally cannot see intermediate results or
    progress reports for long running processes, they must wait till the
   process is completely finished before viewing the results.
<p> 
    Thus the problem of monitoring events is central in distributed
    applications and protocols. A repeated need in such applications is
    to receive notifications when a resource property value changes or
    event state changes. Current database systems provides mechanisms
    like constraints, triggers and active database rules. These
    facilities provides an automated means to ensure the database
    integrity or perform specific action when data changes. Need for
    such kind of requirement is fundamental is network applications.
<p> 
    I will describe the Event Notifications Requirements. I will also
    briefly explain on application of Event Notifications in Software
    engineering environments.
