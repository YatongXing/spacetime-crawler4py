<h2> Notifications Down Under: Ideology and Implementation
</h2>

<h3> Bill Segall, University of Queensland, Distributed Systems

<p>
Based upon our experiences in creating and using the Elvin notification
service, we give a personal interpretation of the issues needed to be
examined and discussed before standardizing notification services. We
present some initial thoughts on notification service fundamentals and
raise some issues about reliability, persistence, security, scalability,
federation, performance and simplicity.
