        As we begin to interact with computers in more numerous and complex ways, as well as use automation in contexts that
        we never have before, how can we best manage the strengths of artificial and human intelligence to enhance people?
        Understanding technology through the lens of design for usability and productivity can help generate best practices
        for the effective use of automation.
        </p>
        <p>
        As an MD-PhD student at University of California, Irvine, Brian is interested in studying technology use in the healthcare
        setting and creating tools that will better enable healthcare providers to focus on the most important part of
        medicine: caring for the patient.
