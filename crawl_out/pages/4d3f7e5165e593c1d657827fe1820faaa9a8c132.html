<H3>Course Description and Prerequisites</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Course Description from the UCI Catalog:
<UL>
<LI> Covers essential tools from discrete mathematics used in computer science 
with an emphasis on the process of abstracting computational problems and 
analyzing them mathematically. 
Topics include mathematical induction, combinatorics, and recurrence relations.
</UL>
<LI> Prerequisites:
<UL>
<LI> ICS 6B, Boolean algebra and logic, is officially listed as "recommended."
Here is what that will mean in practice:
<UL>
<LI> The material from ICS 6B that we will use the most is 
in the first three assigned
chapters (chapters 1, 3, and 4) of the <a href="#textbook"> textbook</a>.
<LI> This material is covered in detail in ICS 6B. 
<LI>  I will cover these chapters during the first week.
The review will proceed at a pace that should be fine if it is truly a review.
However, it may seem quite rushed if your knowledge of it is rusty
or if you have never seen the material before.
<LI> If you find that you are having difficulty with this
introductory material,
I strongly recommend that you drop ICS 6D, take ICS 6B (or study the material
carefully), and then
take ICS 6D at a later time after you have studied this introductory material.
</UL>
<LI>In addition to the above, it is assumed that you know and are
comfortable with:
<UL>
<LI> High-school algebra.
<LI> Basic arithmetic.  Specifically, you should know the multiplication
table up to 12. Using pencil and paper, you should be able to accurately
perform integer multiplication by a 3-digit integer, perform long division
by a 3-digit divisor, perform arithmetic on fractions with up to a 3-digit
denominator.  Calculators are not allowed on tests and exams.

<a name="academicdishonesty"></a>
<H3>Academic Dishonesty:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Academic dishonesty (cheating) is a serious offense
in the eyes of the instructor, the instructional assistants,
ICS, and the university.
Incidents of academic dishonesty will usually result in your receiving
a grade of F in the course and not being allowed to drop the course.
Additional consequences may occur at the academic unit or campus level.
Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
<UL>
<LI> Copying from others during an examination
<LI> Using unauthorized materials during an examination.
<LI> Sharing answers or 
allowing another student to copy off your work during an  examination.
<LI> Tampering with an examination after it has been
corrected,  then returning it for more credit.
<LI> Intentionally disrupting the educational process in any way.
</UL>

procedures, consult the following resources:

    <LI> [I] <i>Dscrete Mathematics</i>, 
         by Sandra Irani, published by Zybooks.
  </UL>
  <LI> <b>You are required to subscribe to the book if you are

<H3>Additional resources</H3>
<UL> 
<LI> A recommended supplementary text is the book <i>Discrete Mathematics and
its Applications</i> by Kenneth H. Rosen   (any edition is fine.)
<b>This book is not required</b>, but you may find it useful.
It has a large number of homework exercises, with answers to all
the odd-numbered exercises.

<H3> Grading</H3>
<UL>
  <LI> Based on three tests,  the final exam , 
       weekly homework assignments, 
       and assigned readings in the online textbook.
  <LI> The individual components will be weighted as follows when
       computing the course grade:
  <UL>
    <LI> Test score (weighted average on tests and final exam):  90%.  
    <UL>  
      <LI>The test score will be computed using the following weights:
      <UL>  
        <LI> Test 1: 22%
        <LI> Test 2: 22%
        <LI> Test 3: 22%
        <LI> Final Exam: 34%
      </UL>
    <LI>The "second-chance" policy described 
        <a href="./testing/second-chance-policy.html">here</a> 
        will be applied.
    </UL>
    <LI> Homework assignments:  5%
    <LI> Readings in the online textbook:  5%
  </UL>
 <a name="tests"></a>
  <LI><b> Tests and Final Exam: </b> 
  <UL>
    <LI> There will be three tests given during the quarter, plus the
         final exam. 
    <LI> The three tests given during the quarter will be given on 
         Thursday of weeks 3, 6,  and 9.
    <LI> Makeup tests will only be given in extraordinary
         and documentable circumstances, and only at the discretion of 
         the instructor.
         If the circumstances are forseeable in advance, notify me 
         as far in advance as posssible.  Failure to do this may result
         your forfeiting your opportunity to take a makeup.
    <LI> The final exam will be given during finals week, in the
         time period designated by the registrar.

        tests and the final exam, including exact date/time.
  </UL>
  <LI><b>Homework:</b> 
  <UL>
   <LI> There will be weekly homework assignments.  
   <LI> Your lowest homework assignment score will be dropped.  
   <LI> A consequence of this policy is that if you do not turn in a homework 
        assignment and hence receive a zero on it, 
        that homework score will be dropped.
        This means that failing to turn in one homework assignment will not
        negatively impact your grade as long as you do well on all the other
        homework assignments.

  </UL>
  <LI><b>Reading Assignments:</b> 
  <UL>
    <LI> There will be reading assignments from the online Zybook textbook.
    <LI> In each section you are assigned to read, you will need to 
         complete the Participation Activities.
    <LI> Generally there will be a reading assignment due one minute before 
         the start of each lecture. 
    <LI> You will be deemed to have satisfactorily completed the reading 
         of a particular section if and only if the Zybook log says that 
         you completed all Participation Activities in the section by the
         deadline.
