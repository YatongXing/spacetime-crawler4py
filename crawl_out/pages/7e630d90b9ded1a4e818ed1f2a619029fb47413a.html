<h2> Lessons in Messaging
</h2>

<p>
Broadcast message servers have been around for ten years now and have
been used extensively in a range of applications.  In this talk we
relate our experiences with messaging in programming environments and
other tools.  We point out several facets of messaging that, while
not immediately obvious, are important considerations in the design
and development of a message system.  We conclude by discussing the
implications of these considerations for wide-area messaging.
