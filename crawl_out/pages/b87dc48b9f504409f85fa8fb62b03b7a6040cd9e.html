<h2>WISEN Presentation Abstract:</h2>

<h2> Internet Scale Event Notification
</h2>

<p>
The organization of WISEN attests to the growing interest among many
different communities in the problem of how to provide efficient delivery of
event notifications on an Internet scale.  But what exactly is "event
notification", and what exactly does "Internet scale" mean?  Each community
has its own interpretation of these terms, and the interpretations typically
reflect the specific needs of the community.  In this talk I will offer a
characterization of Internet scale event notification that is intended to be
acceptable to the broad range of communities represented at WISEN.
