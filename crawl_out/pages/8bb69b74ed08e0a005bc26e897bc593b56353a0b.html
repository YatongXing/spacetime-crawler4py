It was known that planar graphs have O(<i>n</i>) subgraphs isomorphic
to K<sub>3</sub> or K<sub>4</sub>. That is, K<sub>3</sub> and
K<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
<p>
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely
K<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

report: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal
version.

Shows that the minimum area polygon containing <i>k</i> of <i>n</i>

and uses this observation to find the polygon quickly.

We show that thickness and <a href="p-thickness.html">geometric thickness</a>
are not asymptotically equivalent: for every <i>t</i>, there exists a graph with

Stack number is also known as page number or book thickness; it is the
minimum number of stacks needed so that you can process the vertices of
a graph in some sequence, pushing each edge onto one of the stacks when
you process its first endpoint and popping it from the same stack when
you process its second endpoint. Queue number is defined in the same way
using queues instead of stacks. We show that the strong products of
triangular grids and high-degree stars have bounded queue number but
unbounded stack number. This result disproves the
Blankenship&ndash;Oporowski conjecture, according to which subdividing
edges of a graph a constant number of times cannot decrease its stack
number from non-constant to constant, because subdivisions of the same
products also have bounded stack number. It also confirms a conjecture
of Bonnet et al on the existence of graphs with bounded sparse
twin-width and unbounded stack number.
