<h2> SIENA: Scalable Internet Event Notification Architecture
</h2>

<h3> Antonio Carzaniga, University of Colorado at Boulder

<p>
An <i>event service</i> is a general purpose facility that provides
for <i>observation</i> and <i>notification</i> of events among objects
possibly distributed over a network.  Despite event-based
infrastructures have been available for quite a long time for
local-area networks we argue that a number of issues remain to be
solved when these technologies are used in a wide-area network
setting. In particular, we identify <i>scalability</i> and
<i>expressiveness</i> as the two major requirements and we see a
number of trade-offs between these two aspects.  This presentation is
about SIENA, a research project aimed at formulating architectures and
algorithms that implement an event service that is scalable as well as
expressive. The design of the event service interface will be
presented together with a comparison of architectures and routing
strategies. Also a validation study based on systematic simulation
of network scenarios will be discussed.
