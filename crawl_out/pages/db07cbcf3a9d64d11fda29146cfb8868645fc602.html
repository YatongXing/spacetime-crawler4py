<BODY>
<H1>Requirements for Internet scale event notifications</H1>The goal of 
this
session was to identify a set of requirements for an Internet-scale 
event
notification service. More specifically, the discussion developed from
<I>minimal</I> requirements to <I>advanced</I> and 
<I>domain-specific</I>
requirements. Also, the tension between various domain-specific 
requirements led
to discussing the possibility of having one single event service, usable
in
different contexts, as opposed to a number of separate services targeted
to some
particular application domain.
<P><I>Core</I> or <I>minimal</I> requirements define the core 
functionalities of
an Internet-scale event notification service. These are the features 
that a
technology must exhibit in order to qualify as an Internet-scale event
notification service.
<P><I>Advanced</I> features are not mandatory parts of the core service, 
however
they are desirable functionalities that any Internet-scale event 
notification
service should provide either because they are of common utility for
many
classes of applications or because they can not be easily or efficiently 

implemented on top of the core services.
<P>
<H2>Core Requirements</H2>A quite numerous list of core requirements has 
been
proposed. Only some items were analyzed in detail<SPAN=20

and a few comments were made on the interplay between different items.

face=3DArial
    size=3D3>T</FONT></SPAN>he main service provided by an event-based
    infrastructure is the notification of the occurrence of events. 
Objects can
    declare their interest in being notified of the occurrence of an 
event or a
    class of events by issuing a <I>subscription</I>. In other words,
    subscriptions can be used to select notifications. The selection is 
based on
    the <I>content</I> of notifications, which corresponds to the data
    associated with the observation of the event.

    <DT><B>attributes of the notification service</B>
    <DD><SPAN class=3D90003922-31071998><FONT color=3D#000000 
face=3DArial=20
    size=3D3>T</FONT></SPAN>he notification of an event is 
<I>asynchronous</I>
    with respect to the occurrence of the event. Event producers and 
consumers
    are <I>decoupled</I>, i.e., it is not necessary for producers to be 
aware of
    the existence of consumers nor of their identity, and vice-versa. 
Note that
    this principle doesn't require or imply notifications be anonymous. 
A
    notification must be <I>reliably</I> delivered to all the components 
that
    subscribed for it. Most of these aspects can be seen in a more 
general
    perspective in which the <I>quality of service</I> can be 
dynamically
    configured. For example, an object publishing a message can require
    anonymity of the notification. Or conversely, an object subscribing 
for some
    events might require notifications to report information about the
    publisher. As far as <I>reliability</I><SPAN 
class=3D90003922-31071998><FONT=20
    color=3D#000000 face=3DArial size=3D3> </FONT></SPAN><SPAN
    class=3D90003922-31071998><FONT color=3D#000000 face=3DArial 
size=3D3>is concerned,
    </FONT></SPAN>both publishers and subscribers ideally<SPAN
    class=3D90003922-31071998><FONT color=3D#000000 face=3DArial 
size=3D3>
    </FONT></SPAN>should be able to specify different levels or kinds of 

    service. For example, one subscriber might want to receive 
<I>exactly</I>
    one notification for each event while others might accept repeated
    notifications or even lost notifications. The same service 
parameters could
    be set by publishers.
    <DT><B>event notification protocol</B>
    <DD><SPAN class=3D90003922-31071998><FONT color=3D#000000 
face=3DArial
    size=3D3>I</FONT></SPAN>n order to define the interface of the event 
service,
    an event notification <I>protocol</I> or an <I>API</I> should be 
defined.
    The choice of a protocol is preferable because a protocol is more
    language-neutral and it is presumably easier to agree on. Also, 
different
    implementations and vendors can provide extended APIs and 
language-dependent
    bindings that should not be included or constrained by the common 
interface
    definition.
    <P>For the design of this protocol, some extensions of HTTP have 
been
    proposed. The major requirement for an event notification protocol 
is to be
    compatible with existing firewalls. Other obvious requirements are
    extensibility and efficiency. It would also be possible and in some 
cases
    desirable to piggy-back the notification protocol on top of other 
standard
    protocols. </P>
    <DT><B>distributed architecture</B>
    <DD>Although the functionality of the service per se doesn't impose 
this,
    everyone agrees that it is necessary to have some sort of 
distributed
    architecture for the implementation of the service.
    <P></P></DD></DL>
<H2>Advanced Requirements</H2>
<DL>
    <DT><B>extensions and variances of the basic service</B>
    <DD>It has been suggested as a <I>minimalist</I> approach that 
notification
    be idempotent. This supposedly makes the event service simpler 
because it is
    not necessary for it to avoid repeated notification. It should be 
clear that
    this is a requirement on the applications that use the event service 
rather
    than on the event service itself.
    <P>Many applications would benefit from having advanced subscription 

    mechanisms that facilitate the selection of very specific classes of 
events
    as well as sequences of events. As an example consider a security 
monitor,
    in order to detect an intrusion, the monitor might want to receive a 

    notification every time three consecutive failed logins occur for 
the same
    user on any machine in a subnet. Although suggested by 
domain-specific
    applications, this requirement seems to be useful in a generic event 

    notification service.
    <P>The event notification interface, and therefore the event 
notification
    protocol, should allow for objects to be connected to the event 
service
    through <I>proxy</I> agents. This forces an additional de-coupling 
in the
    protocol specification in that it should be possible for an object 
to
    publish (and subscribe) on the behalf of another object.
    <P></P>
    <DT><B>persistence</B>
    <DD>It is clearly necessary for subscriptions to be persistent 
within the
    event service. It has also been argued that the event service should 
provide
    persistent storage of notifications. This feature is also related to 
the
    types of ``call-back'' mechanism that can be registered with 
subscriptions.
    Ideally, the event service should support various communication 
methods,
    possibly including HTTP and SMTP. Also, for every single 
subscription, a
    list of notification call-backs could be registered so that the 
event
    service could try the main one and then fall back to the other ones 
in case
    the main one is not accessible.
    <P>Persistence of notifications is also implied in case the event 
service
    supports a pull-style notification mechanism in which objects 
actively poll
    the service to check for new notifications.
    <P>There has been quite a bit of discussion on this aspect. Some 
think that
    persistence is so crucial that it would be a bad idea to retrofit 
it. On the
    other hand, others argue that persistence should not be handled 
directly by
    the event service, but instead, when required, it could be 
incorporated and
    dealt with by the call-back mechanisms. An example of a persistent 
call-back
    mechanism is e-mail. The impact of persistence should also be 
evaluated with
    respect to scalability. </P>
    <DT><B>mobility</B>
    <DD>Mobile computing technology allows roaming users to access their 

    personal resources from different nodes on a wide-area network. 
Similarly,
    thanks to mobile code technology, applications can ``move'' through 
the net
    requesting services from several access points. This possibility 
poses an
    additional requirement on the event service. In fact, it is 
desirable that
    the event service support mobility by automatically re-routing 
notifications
    to follow users or applications as they move. Clearly, this would 
also
    require to augment the event service interface (and the 
corresponding
    protocol) with the appropriate mobility primitives.
