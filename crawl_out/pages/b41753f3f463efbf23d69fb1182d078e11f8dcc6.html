<h2>WISEN Presentation Abstract:</h2>

<h2> A Minimalist Approach to Distributed Event Notifications
</h2>

<h3> Jim Waldo, Sr. Staff Engineer, Sun Microsystems, Inc.

<p>
Event notifications in a distributed system require dealing with a number of
failure modes and identification problems not present in non-distributed
systems. However, the scaling requirements of large distributed systems (like
the internet) also require interfaces for event notification that are as
simple as possible.
 
I will describe a simple distributed event notification system developed as
part of the work done by the Java(tm) distributed computing group. Some of the
more interesting features, such as transparent interposition of third-party
entities in the delivery chain and the use of portable object code, will be
discussed. Finally, wild speculation will take place as to the relevance of
this work to internet-scale applications.
