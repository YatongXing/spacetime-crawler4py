Subgraph isomorphism
</h2>
Subgraph isomorphism is a very general form of pattern matching in
which one attempts to find a target graph as a subgraph of a larger
input graph.  It is NP-complete, but it has many applications and
algorithms are known for many special cases.
See also my
<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/bibs/subiso.bib">
bibliography of subgraph isomorphism algorithms and applications</a>,
which I collected for my SODA 95 paper.

Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic
to \(K_3\) or \(K_4\).

It was known that planar graphs have O(<i>n</i>) subgraphs isomorphic
to K<sub>3</sub> or K<sub>4</sub>. That is, K<sub>3</sub> and
K<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
<p>
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely
K<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

<p>
For any sparse family of graphs,
one can list in linear time all
complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family.
There are O(n) complete bipartite subgraphs of a graph in the family,
and the sum of the numbers of vertices in these subgraphs is also O(n).
<p>
Nowadays these results can also be interpreted as a form of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis">formal
concept analysis</a>. If a set of objects and attributes is sparse
(e.g., if it is generated by adding objects and attributes one at a
time, where each newly-added object is given O(1) attributes and each
newly-added attribute is held by O(1) objects) then the total size of
all concepts in its concept lattice is linear, and this lattice may be
generated in linear time.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "<a href="p-dtwmcgf.html">Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families</a>", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
<p>
This paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth
property</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
<p>Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"<a href="p-psgi.html">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems</a>" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "<a
href="https://doi.org/10.1145/504794.504798">Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>", <i>J. ACM</i>
48: 1184&ndash;1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "<a href="https://erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/">Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>", <i>Algorithmica</i>
40: 211&ndash;215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

We define the h-index of a graph to be the maximum h such that the graph
has h vertices each of which has degree at least h. We show that the
h-index, and a partition of the graph into high and low degree vertices,
may be maintained in constant time per update. Based on this technique,
we show how to maintain the number of triangles in a dynamic graph in
time O(h) per update; this problem is motivated by Markov Chain Monte
Caro simulation of the Exponential Random Graph Model used for
simulation of social networks. We also prove
bounds on the h-index for scale-free graphs and investigate the behavior
of the h-index on a corpus of real social networks.

We describe an algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph, in
time O(dn3<sup>d/3</sup>) where n is the number of vertices and d is the
degeneracy of the graph, a standard measure of its sparsity. This time
bound matches the worst-case output size for these parameters. The
algorithm modifies the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for maximal cliques by
ordering the vertices by degree in the outer recursive call of the algorithm.
